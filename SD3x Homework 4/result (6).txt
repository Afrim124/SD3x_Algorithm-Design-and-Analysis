8 tests passed.
14 tests failed.
#1. mustExist() test on large graph with many edges that must exist is incorrect
#2. arbitrageOpportunity() is incorrect on large graph 2
#3.  One of the test cases timed out, probably due to an inefficient solution (arbitrageLarge4(PrivateTests))
#4. mustExist() test on large graph with multiple weights, 2 must exist, has incorrect number of edges
#5. arbitrageOpportunity() does not output a cycle of negative weight on test with small arbitrage cycle, and some additional vertices
#6. arbitrageOpportunity() throws Exception java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 12 on test with medium-size graph
#7. mustNotExist() test on small cyclical graph 2has incorrect number of edges
#8. mustNotExist() test on graph with multiple cycles outputs incorrect number of edges
#9.  One of the test cases timed out, probably due to an inefficient solution (noArbitrageLarge1(PrivateTests))
#10.  One of the test cases timed out, probably due to an inefficient solution (noArbitrageLarge3(PrivateTests))
#11. mustExist() test on medium size graph, 1 must exist, has incorrect number of edges
#12. mustExist() test on medium size graph with multiple weights, 2 must exist, has incorrect number of edges
#13. mustNotExist() test on 10-node graph with many edges outputs incorrect number of edges
#14. mustNotExist() test on 10-node graph 2 with many edges outputs incorrect number of edges
